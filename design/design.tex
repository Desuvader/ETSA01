\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{subsec:introduction-purpose}

This document describes the design of the \textit{Bicycle Garage Pro} software.

The intended audience of this document is primarily the developers responsible
for producing and maintaining the software. The document's purpose is to act as
a guideline during development.

\subsection{Glossary}
\label{subsec:introduction-glossary}
See section 1.2 in the Requirement Specification for Bicycle Garage Pro

\subsection{Scope}
\label{subsec:introduction-scope}

This document is intented to be read in combination with the project's
\textit{Requirements Specification} and \textit{Test plan}, both
referred to in \textit{section \ref{sec:references}: \nameref{sec:references}}.


% ----- ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW -------------------------------------------------

\section{Software design overview}

The entire software shall be able to be packaged into a JAR file to be run on a
JVM installed on the main computer in the BGP system. Therefore, the software
shall be written in a JVM-compatible language such as Java, Clojure or Scala.
This particular document describes the software as written in the Java language;
the rationale for this being that Java is an easily accessible and widely known
language. The software thus becomes easy to distribute among BGP systems across
the world.

\subsection{Detailed system description}
\label{sec:detailed-system-description}

See \cref{fig:lol} under \cref{app:example-appendix-section} for the UML diagram that describes the relations between the internal software classes.

\subsection{Modules or Java \texttt{package}s}

This section describes the different modules, organized by Java
\texttt{package}s, that compose the BGP software.

\subsubsection{\texttt{bicyclegarage}}

Below are the classes found in \texttt{package bicyclegarage}.

\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
	\item [\texttt{Bicycle}]	\hfill \\
		Describes a bicycle owned by a user.

	\item [\texttt{User}]		\hfill \\
		Describes a cyclist using the BGP system.

	\item [\texttt{UserDB}]		\hfill \\
		Mainly handles database saving/loading

	\item [\texttt{Garage}]		\hfill \\
		Ties classes together. Contains the GUI.

	\item [\texttt{Manager}]	\hfill \\
		Mainly implements the methods needed to make the garage work

\end{description}

\subsubsection{\texttt{interfaces}}
Contains the hardware interfaces. Not within this project scope, but still mentioned for convinience sake.
\subsubsection{\texttt{testdrivers}}
Hardware implementations. Not within this project scope, but still mentioned for convinience sake.
