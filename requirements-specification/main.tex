\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document describes the requirements and functionalities of the \emph{Bicycle Garage Pro} software.

The intended audience of this document are mainly: software developers, in order to aid the development of the software; and clients, in order to provide an accurate overview of the project.

\subsection{Glossary}
Despite this being a software-only specification, relevant hardware-related terms are still explained for convenience's sake.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item General terms
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item BGP - Bicycle Garage Pro (software)
		\item ACME - The company which BGP is produced for
		\item User - A cyclist who uses the Bicycle Garage Pro system
		\item Operator - Subject responsible for managing BGP (on-site)
		\item Entrance - Main entrance door of the garage. Electronic lock.
		\item Exit 1 - Garage exit for users with bicycles. Electronic lock.
		\item Exit 2 - Garage exit for users without bicycles. Can be opened from inside the garage.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Software-related terms
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item (The) System - Bicycle Garage Pro software
		\item CLI - Command line interface
		\item CRUD - Create, read, update and delete (operations)
		\item PIN - 4-digit code, used to access the garage
		\item API - Application programming interface
		\item Database - System-relevant data is store in the database
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Hardware-related terms
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item PC - Personal computer
		\item LED - Light-emitting diode
		\item Barcode reader - Device that can read/scan barcodes
		\item Barcode printer - Device that can print barcodes
		\item PIN terminal - Terminal where a PIN can be entered
		\item Electronic lock - Electronically controlled lock on the entrance and exit 1
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope}
BGP is a software application that manages a bicycle garage. This requirement specification only covers the software part for the bicycle garage and the following assumptions are therefore made about the hardware:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The hardware handles recognition and reading (scanning) of barcodes
	\item The hardware handles printing of barcodes
	\item The hardware handles locking and unlocking of doors
	\item The hardware handles reading of PINs
\end{enumerate}
The hardware, as stated above, will be accessed by the system according to a predefined API. See \cref{app:hardware} for a more detailed description of the API.

\subsection{Goals}
\subsubsection{Business goals}
ACME is a company that works in the bicycle garage business in Sweden. ACME aims to provide low-cost, semi-automated bicycle garage solutions for public use. The goals for ACME with this software are mainly:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Customer retention through maintainability
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Product goals}
The goal of BGP is to assist in managing a bicycle garage by keeping track of users and their bicycles. The user interface should be simple to use and the software should be easily maintainable for future developers.

\subsection{Overview}
The structure of this specification is based on guidelines from the ETSA01 course website and the ETSA01 course compendium \cite{kompendium,course-site}.

\section{Product description}
\label{sec:proddesc}

For clarification purposes, see \cref{fig:garage} for an example on how the complete garage facility (physical) can look like. The PC runs BGP.

The interactions between the system and external entities, that may interact with the system, can be seen in \cref{fig:context-hw}. The control unit is the BGP software. The arrows in \cref{fig:context-hw} mainly aim to specify software-related signals that are relevant to this specification.

	\caption{Context diagram for BGP}
	\label{fig:context-hw}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item The control unit sends out the following signals:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item lightLED - Sent out depending on success/failure when entering PIN or scanning barcode
		\item printBarcode - Sent out when a barcode should be printed through the barcode printer
		\item open - Sent out to either the entrance or exit 1, and unlocks the door (electronic lock)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The control unit receives the following signals:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item entryCharacter - Received when a button is pressed on the PIN terminal
		\item entryBarcode - Received when a barcode is scanned at the entrance
		\item exitBarcode - Received when a barcode is scanned at the exit
		\item addUser - Received when the operator wants to add an user
		\item removeUser - Received when the operator wants to remove an user
		\item getUserByNIN - Received when the operator wants to search for an user by national identification number
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Interface}
BGP should support the API defined in \cref{sec:proddesc}.
\subsection{Use cases}
\label{sec:cases}
The use cases below are the most typical scenarios that one would run into when using the bicycle garage. The idea is that the system should at least be able to handle these use cases. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete description of the system and should therefore not be used as the main guidelines for developing the system.

\begin{usecase}
	\addtitle{Use case 1:}{User wants to store a bicycle}
	\addfield{Primary actor:}{User}
	\addfield{Preconditions:}{User is registered.}
	\addfield{Postconditions:}{The bicycle of the user checked in.}
	\addscenario{Main success scenario:}{
		\item User scans their barcode at the entrance.
		\item The entrance door unlocks.
	}
	\addscenario{Exception scenarios:}{
		\item [1.a] Barcode is not recognized:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item[1.] Use case ends here. The remaining steps are skipped.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item [1.b] Bicycle is already checked in:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item[1.] Use case ends here. The remaining steps are skipped.
			\end{enumerate}
	}
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}
	\addtitle{Use case 2:}{User wants to retrieve a bicycle}

				\item[2.] User will have to contact the operator for assistance.
			\end{enumerate}
	}
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}

	\addfield{Preconditions:}{User is registered. Garage is full.}
	\addscenario{Main success scenario:}{
