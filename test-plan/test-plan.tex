\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Tested system}
\label{subsec:tested-system}

The system described in this document is the software for a public bicycle
garage. This software is responsible for managing the authentication of users
and the management of their information and their bicycles.

This document provides a specification for testing the bicycle garage software.
The test process consists of the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Unit testing
	\item System testing
	\item Acceptance testing
\end{itemize}

% ----- TEST PROCESS -----------------------------------------------------------

\section{Test process}
\label{sec:test-process}

\subsection{Process overview}
\label{subsec:test-process-process-overview}

The tests of the software are carried out on several levels of abstraction:

\begin{itemize}
\item
At the lowest level, \textit{unit testing} is performed which aim to test each
line of code inside the software.
\item
These units are grouped into modules, which would
normally be tested through the API or \textit{Application Programming
Interface}, a process known as \textit{integration testing}. For this software
however, integration testing will not be performed due to the smallness of the
software.
\item
On an even higher level of abstraction, so called \textit{system testing} is
performed which ensures that the requirements provided in the \textit{Software
Requirements Specification} are fulfilled.
\item
Lastly, \textit{acceptance testing} is performed. However, acceptance
testing is performed by the customer and thus not within the scope of this
document.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-unit-testing}

Unit testing aims to test each line of software code. Every non-trivial function
is tested in software through the use of a test suite library.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Structural
	\item[Criteria:]	Every important line of code is tested
	\item[Stop rule:]	No errors found
\end{description}

%\subsection{Integration testing}
%\label{subsec:test-process-integration-testing}
%
%Integration testing is performed in a similar way to unit testing, but larger
%and more inclusive modules are tested. Each module is tested in software through
%the use of a test suite library.
%
%\begin{description}
%	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
%	\item[Type of test:]	Structural
%	\item[Criteria:]	Every API method is tested completely
%	\item[Stop rule:]	No errors found
%\end{description}
%

\subsection{System testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-system-testing}

During system testing, all requirements specified inside the \textit{Software
Requirements Specification} are tested.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Functional
	\item[Criteria:]	All requirements inside the SRS are fulfilled
	\item[Stop rule:]	No critical errors found
\end{description}

\subsection{Acceptance testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-acceptance-testing}

Acceptance testing is performed by the client and not by the developers, and is
thus not discussed in this document.

% ----- TESTED ITEMS -----------------------------------------------------------


% ----- TEST RECORDING PROCEDURE -----------------------------------------------

\section{Test recording procedure}
\label{sec:test-recording-procedure}

\subsection{Unit testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-unit-testing}

Every non-trivial piece of software code is tested individially by the
developers. These tests are automated and performed incrementally as the
code base grows. The results of these tests do not have to be recorded; the
rationale for this being that the tests provide enough assurance on their own
and that the size of the test log would soon grow out of hand.

%
%\subsection{Integration testing}
%\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-integration-testing}
%

\subsection{System testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-system-testing}

For each test session carried out, a new requirements coverage matrix shall be
produced according to the one shown in \textit{Appendix \ref{app:RCM}:
Requirements Coverage Matrix}. In a document containing this matrix, the result
of each test case shall be displayed. Any faults found shall be reported to the
developers, either directly or through the use of a shared file where error
reports are logged.

\subsection{Acceptance testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-acceptance-testing}

Acceptance testing is performed by the client and not by the developers, and is
thus not discussed in this document.


% ----- TEST CASES FOR SYSTEM TESTING ------------------------------------------

\section{Test cases for system testing}
\label{sec:test-cases-for-system-testing}

\subsection{Test cases}
\label{subsec:test-cases}

Since unit testing is performed in the software environment and acceptance
testing is performed by the customer, only system testing will be fully
described in this document. For this purpose, please refer to
\textit{Appendix \ref{app:test-cases}: \nameref{app:test-cases}}.

\subsection{Requirements coverage and traceability}
\label{subsec:requirements-coverage-and-testability}

All functional requirements provided in the \textit{Software Requirements
Specification} should be tested by at least on test case to ensure that all
functionality is tested. For this purpose, a \textit{requirements coverage
matrix} is used. For this matrix, please refer to \textit{Appendix
\ref{app:RCM}: Requirements Coverage Matrix}.
