\subsection{Tested system}
\label{subsec:tested-system}

The system described in this document is the software for a public bicycle
garage. This software is responsible for managing the authentication of users
and the management of their information and their bicycles.

This document provides a specification for testing the bicycle garage software.
The test process consists of the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Unit testing
	\item Integration testing
	\item System testing
	\item Acceptance testing
\end{itemize}

% ----- TEST PROCESS -----------------------------------------------------------

\section{Test process}
\label{sec:test-process}

\subsection{Process overview}
\label{subsec:test-process-process-overview}

The tests of the software are carried out on several levels of abstraction. At
the lowest level, \textit{unit testing} is performed which aim to test each line
of code inside the software. These units are grouped into modules, which are
tested through the API or \textit{Application Programming Interface}, a process
known as \textit{integration testing}. On an even higher level of abstraction,
so called \textit{system testing} is performed which ensures that the
requirements provided in the \textit{Software Requirements Specification} are
fulfilled. Lastly, \textit{acceptance testing} is performed. However, acceptance
testing is performed by the customer and thus not within the scope of this
document.

\subsection{Unit testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-unit-testing}

Unit testing aims to test each line of software code. Every non-trivial function
is tested in software through the use of a test suite library.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Structural
	\item[Criteria:]	Every line of code is tested
	\item[Stop rule:]	No errors found
\end{description}


\subsection{Integration testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-integration-testing}

Integration testing is performed in a similar way to unit testing, but larger
and more inclusive modules are tested. Each module is tested in software through
the use of a test suite library.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Structural
	\item[Criteria:]	Every API method is tested completely
	\item[Stop rule:]	No errors found
\end{description}


\subsection{System testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-system-testing}

During system testing, all requirements specified inside the Software
Requirements Specification are tested.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Functional
	\item[Criteria:]	All requirements inside the SRS are fulfilled
	\item[Stop rule:]	No critical errors found
\end{description}

\subsection{Acceptance testing}
\label{subsec:test-process-acceptance-testing}

Acceptance testing is performed by the client and not by the developers, and is
thus not discussed in this document.

% ----- TESTED ITEMS -----------------------------------------------------------

\section{Tested items}
\label{sec:tested-items}

TODO \\

... perhaps this section should be removed? In the example found in the green
booklet for the course, this section is nothing but a repetition of what has
already been said.


% ----- TEST RECORDING PROCEDURE -----------------------------------------------

\section{Test recording procedure}
\label{sec:test-recording-procedure}

\subsection{Unit testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-unit-testing}

Every non-trivial piece of software code is tested individially by the
developers. These tests are automated and performed incrementally as the
code base grows. The results of these tests do not have to be recorded; the
rationale for this being that the tests provide enough assurance on their own
and that the size of the test log would soon grow out of hand.

\subsection{Integration testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-integration-testing}

TODO

\subsection{System testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-system-testing}

TODO

\subsection{Acceptance testing}
\label{subsec:test-recording-procedure-acceptance-testing}

Acceptance testing is performed by the client and not by the developers, and is
thus not discussed in this document.


% ----- TEST CASES FOR SYSTEM TESTING ------------------------------------------

\section{Test cases for system testing}
\label{sec:test-cases-for-system-testing}

\subsection{Test cases}
\label{subsec:test-cases}

Since unit- and integration testing is performed in the software environment and
acceptance testing is performed by the customer, only system testing will be
fully described in this document. For this purpose, please refer to
\textit{Appendix \ref{app:test-cases}: \nameref{app:test-cases}}.

\subsection{Requirements coverage and traceability}
\label{subsec:requirements-coverage-and-testability}

All functional requirements provided in the \textit{Software Requirements
Specification} should be tested by at least on test case to ensure that all
functionality is tested. For this purpose, a \textit{requirements coverage
matrix} is used.
