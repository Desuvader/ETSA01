\subsection{Tested system}

The system described in this document is the software for a public bicycle
garage. This software is responsible for managing the authentication of users
and the management of their information and their bicycles.

This document provides a specification for testing the bicycle garage software.
The test process consists of the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Unit testing
	\item Integration testing
	\item System testing
	\item Acceptance testing
\end{itemize}

% ----- TEST PROCESS -----------------------------------------------------------

\section{Test process}
\label{sec:test-process}
\subsection{Process overview}


\subsection{Unit testing}
\label{subsec:unit-testing}

Every non-trivial function is tested in software through the use of a test suite
library.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Structural
	\item[Criteria:]	Every line of code is tested
	\item[Stop rule:]	No errors found
\end{description}


\subsection{Integration testing}
\label{subsec:integration-testing}

Integration testing is performed in a similar way to unit testing, but larger
and more inclusive modules are tested. Each module is tested in software through
the use of a test suite library.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Structural
	\item[Criteria:]	Every API method is tested completely
	\item[Stop rule:]	No errors found
\end{description}


\subsection{System testing}
\label{subsec:system-testing}

During system testing, all requirements specified inside the Software
Requirements Specification are tested.

\begin{description}
	\item[Performed by:]	Developers
	\item[Type of test:]	Functional
	\item[Criteria:]	All requirements inside the SRS are fulfilled
	\item[Stop rule:]	No critical errors found
\end{description}

\subsection{Acceptance testing}

Acceptance testing is performed by the client and not the developers, and is
therefore not discussed in this document.

	\addscenario{Main success scenario:}{
		\item The operator provides the required user information to the
			control interface.
		\item A new PIN code is generated for the user.
		\item The user is added to the system.

		\item The system responds with an error message, e.g. ''The user
			is already registered.''

	\addfield{Postconditions:}{User is unregistered}
	\addscenario{Main success scenario:}{

			control interface.
		\item A unique 5-digit identification number is generated and
			associated with the bicycle.
		\item The bicycle is added to the set of bicycles owned by the
			user.
		\item A barcode associated with the 5-digit ID is printed and
			given to the user.
