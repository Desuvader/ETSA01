\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project model}

\subsection{Purpose}

The aim of the project is to develop software for a bicycle garage which
provides safe storage of bicycles. The software will be developed for
prespecified hardware.

\subsection{Goals}

\subsubsection{Product goals}

The software shall be able to securely handle users checking in and out their
bicycles of the garage. 

The product will take care of users passing through the entrance with their
bicycle - the user will enter a PIN code and scan a barcode for their bicycle to
store it. The user can then exit the garage, and to exit with a bicycle the same
procedure will be done as the one to store it.

For a more detailed overview of the product, please refer to
\textit{Requirements Specification for Bicycle Garage Pro}.

\subsubsection{Business goals}

To offer cheap and reliable bicycle storage to customers, whom may want to
protect their bicycle against misfortune and use the bicycle instead of public
transport of their cars.

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{description}
\item[Hardware limitations] \hfill \\ 
Since the software must make use of prespecified hardware, there is a limit set
by factors other than that of the software's implementation that will decide
how effective the system will be at doing its job. If there are fundamental
flaws in the hardware, the software too will suffer. To counter this potential
issue, thorough testing must be implemented in the software.

\item[Temporal limitations] \hfill \\
In addition, there is a clear deadline for the project. This may result in an
unfinished and/or underdeveloped product being released, which may result in
expensive bugs and a bad reputation should the software fail its customers.

\item[Economical limitations] \hfill \\
The budget is limited, and thus more developers or other personnel cannot be
hired.

		The planning of the project; also this rapport.
	\item[Requirements specification] \hfill \\
		The requirements for the project are identified and defined.
		This results in a requirements specification.
	\item[Test plan] \hfill \\
		The planning of all tests that will be performed.
		This results in a test plan.
	\item[Design] \hfill \\
		A general description of the systems structure.

	\item[Integration] \hfill \\
		This part is the finishing part of the program,
		which leads to a fully functioning program.
	\item[System test] \hfill \\
		The system is tested in its entirety. This takes part in a
		testing environment which mimics the environment that the
		program will be used in.

% ----- REPORT, FOLLOW-UP AND QUALITY ASSURANCE --------------------------------

\section{Report, follow-up and quality assurance}

To make collaboration easy when writing both the software and the project
related documents, the version control system \textit{Git} will be used, with
the files hosted on the free Git hosting platform \textit{GitHub}. In addition,
both internal and external reviews will be conducted in a common \textit{Google
Drive} folder, using the \textit{Google Docs} service.

All PDF versions of the documents will be found in the Google Drive folder when
they need to be there. The latest versions shall always be available on GitHub.

During the seminar sessions provided, the group will gather and discuss further
plans for the project, as well as meet with the tutor who will provide feedback
on the documents handed in through the Google Drive folder.

Communication within the group will be conducted through a social media platform
previously agreed on, or through email if necessary. The reason for primarily
using a social media platform for this purpose is that communication is faster
and more interactive than if one were to solely use emails. Additionally, commit
messages on Git shall be clear and provide a third means of communication.
